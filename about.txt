the questions below, so we can get to know each other!

What's your name?
My name is Luke!

What's your favorite game?
I love The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The feeling I got when I first escaped the prison and saw this huge
fantasy world opening up before me — and the understanding that I could go ANYWHERE — is one of the most
amazing feelings I've ever gotten from a game.

Why did you want to take this class?
Well, I'm teaching it! I've wanted to give back to the coding community in the form of teaching
ever since I attended a coding bootcamp and got an amazing technical education from
incredible teachers.

What's one thing you really want to learn?
I'm hoping to learn a lot about the nuts and bolts of teaching — and about each of you. I want
to know how you learn as individuals and how I can help you get the most out of this course.

What's something only people who know you really well know about you?
When I was a kid, I was convinced my parents found me in the yard in a spaceship,
like Superman.
